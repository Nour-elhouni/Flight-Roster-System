# Flight Roster Management System

A university group project developed for a Computer Engineering course.  
This system provides a web-based platform to manage flights, crew assignments, and seat allocation.

## Project Overview

The **Flight Roster Management System** is designed to support three main user roles:

- **Admin** – manages flights, crew, and seat assignments  
- **Staff** – views assigned flights  
- **Passengers** – view flight and seat information  

The system helps organize airline operations in a simple, structured, and user-friendly way.

## My Role

I worked on both the **Frontend and its integration with the Backend**.

My responsibilities included:

- Designing and building the **Admin and Passenger interfaces**
- Implementing the full **Create Flight, Update Flight, Assign Seats, and Success flows**
- Structuring the UI layout and navigation
- Connecting the frontend to the backend using API requests (`fetch`)
- Sending and receiving flight, crew, captain, and seat data
- Handling form submissions and backend responses
- Ensuring the full workflow (create → confirm → assign → manage) works correctly

This allowed the system to operate as a real connected web application.
